Here's a complete **interview-grade explanation** of the classic **Aggressive Cows** problem (also known as **Maximize Minimum Distance Between Elements**) — using **Binary Search on Answer**.

# 🐄 Aggressive Cows — Binary Search on Answer

---

## ✅ Problem Statement

You are given positions of `n` stalls in a barn. You need to place `k` cows in the stalls such that the **minimum distance** between any two cows is **as large as possible**.

> Return this **maximum possible minimum distance**.

📌 Example:

```text
Input: positions = [1, 2, 8, 4, 9], cows = 3
Output: 3

Explanation:
Place cows at positions: 1, 4, 8 or 1, 4, 9
The minimum distance is 3.
```

## 🧠 Intuition

* We want to **maximize the minimum distance** between cows.
* The **minimum distance** is our answer space → use **Binary Search on Answer**.
* Try to place cows with a guessed minimum distance.

    * If possible, try a **larger** distance (go right).
    * If not possible, try **smaller** distance (go left).

| Clue From Problem                     | Pattern / Technique         |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Maximize minimum distance             | Binary Search on Answer     |
| Need feasibility check for a distance | Greedy placement simulation |
| Input is a set of positions           | Sort and then process       |

## ✅ Java Code with Full Inline Explanation

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public static int aggressiveCows(int[] stalls, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(stalls); // Sort stalls to place cows in order

        int low = 1; // Minimum possible distance (at least 1)
        int high = stalls[stalls.length - 1] - stalls[0]; // Max possible distance
        int result = -1;

        // Binary search to maximize minimum distance
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            if (canPlaceCows(stalls, k, mid)) {
                result = mid;      // mid is possible → try larger
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;    // mid too large → try smaller
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

    // Greedy check: can we place all cows with at least 'minDist' between them?
    private static boolean canPlaceCows(int[] stalls, int cows, int minDist) {
        int count = 1; // Place first cow at first stall
        int lastPlaced = stalls[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < stalls.length; i++) {
            if (stalls[i] - lastPlaced >= minDist) {
                count++;
                lastPlaced = stalls[i]; // Place cow
            }
            if (count >= cows) return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```

## 🔂 Step-by-Step Dry Run

### Input:

```java
stalls = [1, 2, 8, 4, 9], k = 3
```

1. Sort stalls → `[1, 2, 4, 8, 9]`
2. Search range: `low = 1`, `high = 8`
3. Try mid = 4 → Not feasible (can't place 3 cows)
4. Try mid = 3 → ✅ feasible (1, 4, 8)
5. Try mid = 5 → Not feasible
6. Try mid = 4 again → binary search ends

✅ Answer = 3

## 📚 Concepts & Patterns Used

| Concept                 | Role in Solution                    |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Binary Search on Answer | Optimize over a value range         |
| Greedy                  | Place cows as early as possible     |
| Sorting                 | Needed for ordered greedy placement |

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity

| Metric | Complexity          |
| ------ | ------------------- |
| Time   | `O(n log(max-min))` |
| Space  | `O(1)`              |

* `n` = number of stalls
* Binary search over distance range (from 1 to max-min)
