Let's dive into the **"Time Needed to Inform All Employees"** problem ‚Äì a **classic hierarchical BFS/DFS** traversal question used in FAANG interviews.

# ‚è∞ Time Needed to Inform All Employees ‚Äì Full Explanation

---

## üìò Problem Statement

You are given:

* `n` employees (IDs from 0 to n-1).
* `headID` ‚Üí ID of the head of the company.
* `manager[i]` ‚Üí direct manager of employee `i`. `manager[headID] == -1`.
* `informTime[i]` ‚Üí time manager `i` takes to inform their direct subordinates.

You need to compute **how long it takes to inform all employees** starting from `headID`.

---

## üîç How to Identify the Pattern

* The data describes a **hierarchy/tree**: each employee has **exactly one manager**, so this is a **rooted tree**.
* Each manager has a **fixed time** to pass information to their direct reports ‚Üí think of **weighted levels**.
* We need to propagate info **from root to all leaves**, and find the **maximum time taken**.

‚úÖ This is a **Tree Traversal** problem.
‚úÖ Use **BFS** (level-order) or **DFS** (depth-first).
‚úÖ At each level, **accumulate time** as we go deeper.

---

## üí° Concepts & Patterns Used

* **Tree / Graph**
* **BFS or DFS traversal**
* **Top-down accumulation of weights**
* **Max of all leaf paths**

---

## üìö Summary for Quick Revision

* Build a graph of subordinates using adjacency list.
* Start BFS or DFS from `headID` with time 0.
* At each node, add its `informTime` to cumulative time.
* Track the **max time** taken to reach any employee.

## ‚úÖ Java Code (BFS Approach) with Full Inline Comments

```java
import java.util.*;

public class InformEmployees {

    public static int numOfMinutes(int n, int headID, int[] manager, int[] informTime) {
        // Step 1: Build tree using adjacency list
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> tree = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            tree.computeIfAbsent(manager[i], x -> new ArrayList<>()).add(i);
        }

        // Step 2: BFS queue to store <employeeId, timeTaken>
        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(new int[]{headID, 0});

        int maxTime = 0;

        // Step 3: Standard BFS
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] current = queue.poll();
            int empId = current[0];
            int timeSoFar = current[1];

            maxTime = Math.max(maxTime, timeSoFar); // track maximum time to any node

            // Visit all direct subordinates
            if (tree.containsKey(empId)) {
                for (int sub : tree.get(empId)) {
                    queue.offer(new int[]{sub, timeSoFar + informTime[empId]});
                }
            }
        }

        return maxTime;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 6;
        int headID = 2;
        int[] manager = {2, 2, -1, 2, 2, 2};
        int[] informTime = {0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0};

        System.out.println("Time to inform all employees: " + numOfMinutes(n, headID, manager, informTime)); // Output: 1
    }
}
```

## üß™ Step-by-Step Dry Run (Sample Input)

```text
n = 6
headID = 2
manager =  [2, 2, -1, 2, 2, 2]
informTime = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
```

* Manager 2 has subordinates: \[0,1,3,4,5]
* informTime\[2] = 1

BFS:

* Queue: (2, 0)
* Pop 2, push all subordinates with time = 0+1 = 1
* All employees get informed in 1 unit time.

**Output: 1**

---

## üß† Layman Explanation

* Imagine a company tree: CEO at the top.
* Each manager tells their subordinates after a fixed delay.
* You start a timer at the top and watch how long it takes for the last employee to hear the message.
* Use BFS to simulate this info spreading level-by-level.

---

## üß† How to Pick BFS vs DFS?

* If you want **maximum depth/time** ‚Üí both BFS and DFS work.
* Use **BFS** for level-by-level traversal (preferred in interview).
* Use **DFS** if you want recursive tree logic.

---

## üß† Real-Life Use Case

* **Notification systems** where delays depend on intermediate nodes.
* **Command chain communication** in hierarchical organizations.
* **Propagation delay analysis** in computer networks or email chains.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity

### Time Complexity:

* `O(n)` ‚Üí each employee is visited once.

### Space Complexity:

* `O(n)` ‚Üí adjacency list + queue.

## üöÄ Optional DFS Code (for Comparison)

```java
public int numOfMinutes(int n, int headID, int[] manager, int[] informTime) {
    List<List<Integer>> tree = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) tree.add(new ArrayList<>());
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (manager[i] != -1)
            tree.get(manager[i]).add(i);
    }
    return dfs(headID, tree, informTime);
}

private int dfs(int curr, List<List<Integer>> tree, int[] informTime) {
    int max = 0;
    for (int child : tree.get(curr)) {
        max = Math.max(max, dfs(child, tree, informTime));
    }
    return informTime[curr] + max;
}
```
