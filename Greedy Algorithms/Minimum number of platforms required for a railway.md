# 🚉 Minimum Number of Platforms Required

## 💬 Problem Statement

Given arrival and departure times of trains at a railway station, find the **minimum number of platforms** required so that **no train waits**.

### 📥 Input:

* `arr[]`: Arrival times of trains (in 24-hour format)
* `dep[]`: Departure times of trains (in 24-hour format)
* `n`: Number of trains

### 📤 Output:

* Minimum number of platforms needed

---

## 🧠 Intuition

If a train arrives before another departs, we **need an additional platform**.
We can use a **greedy + two pointer** approach, or even better, a **priority queue**, but sorting both arrays and using two pointers gives an optimal solution.

## 🔍 How to Identify the Pattern

| Problem Clue                         | Pattern to Use               |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Minimum resources (platforms) needed | Greedy / Two Pointers        |
| Overlapping intervals                | Sort + Traverse both arrays  |
| Scheduling with minimum constraints  | Sweep Line / Merge Intervals |

## ✅ Approach (Two Pointer Method)

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Sort** both `arr[]` and `dep[]` arrays.
2. Initialize two pointers:

    * `i = 1` (tracks next train arrival)
    * `j = 0` (tracks current train departure)
3. Initialize `platforms = 1` and `maxPlatforms = 1`
4. Traverse until either array ends:

    * If `arr[i] <= dep[j]`: Need **more platforms**, increment `platforms`, `i++`
    * Else: A train departs → decrement `platforms`, `j++`
    * Update `maxPlatforms = max(maxPlatforms, platforms)`
5. Return `maxPlatforms`

## ✅ Java Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public static int findPlatform(int[] arr, int[] dep, int n) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        Arrays.sort(dep);

        int platforms = 1, maxPlatforms = 1;
        int i = 1, j = 0;

        while (i < n && j < n) {
            if (arr[i] <= dep[j]) {
                platforms++; // new train needs platform
                i++;
            } else {
                platforms--; // train departed
                j++;
            }
            maxPlatforms = Math.max(maxPlatforms, platforms);
        }

        return maxPlatforms;
    }
}
```

## 🧪 Dry Run

### Input:

```text
arr[] = [900, 940, 950, 1100, 1500, 1800]
dep[] = [910, 1200, 1120, 1130, 1900, 2000]
```

### After Sorting:

```
arr = [900, 940, 950, 1100, 1500, 1800]
dep = [910, 1120, 1130, 1200, 1900, 2000]
```

### Steps:

* 900 arrives → platform = 1
* 940 arrives before 910 departs → platform = 2
* 950 arrives before 910 departs → platform = 3
* 910 departs → platform = 2
* 1100 arrives before 1120 departs → platform = 3
* 1120 departs → platform = 2
* ...

✅ Final `maxPlatforms = 3`

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

| Metric              | Value                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| ⏳ Time Complexity   | `O(N log N)` (for sorting) |
| 💾 Space Complexity | `O(1)` (no extra space)    |
