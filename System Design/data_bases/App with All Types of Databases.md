Great — let’s build a single, concrete example application that uses every database type you listed so a learner can instantly see:
•	what data goes where,
•	why each database is the right fit, and
•	how real features pull data from multiple systems.

I’ll name the app StreamShop — a realistic, end-to-end multimedia + social + commerce platform (think Netflix + YouTube + LinkedIn + Amazon mashed into one). Then I’ll walk through features, the exact DB chosen for each feature, sample schemas/queries, and the multi-DB flows (writes and reads).

⸻

StreamShop — short pitch

A platform where users watch videos (movies, trailers, livestreams), post content, follow creators, buy merch/tickets, search content, and get personalized recommendations. We need:
•	transactional correctness (billing, subscriptions)
•	sub-ms caches & leaderboards (real-time UI)
•	billions of events ingested for analytics & ML
•	semantic search and RAG for help docs
•	relationship queries (followers / social graph)
•	fast analytics dashboards & ad-hoc queries

This lets us justify and demonstrate every major DB type.

⸻

End-to-end example flows (write then read)

I’ll step through three representative user stories and show which DBs get involved and sample queries.

⸻

A. User watches a movie (Write-heavy, multi-target writes)

Event: user u123 watches movie m101 (duration 18m)

Write steps (safe, reliable pattern):
1.	API receives POST /watch and writes to NewSQL (source of truth for user actions / receipts):

INSERT INTO user_watch (user_id, movie_id, watched_at, device, duration)
VALUES ('u123','m101','2025-10-02T21:10:00Z','iPhone', 1080);

	•	Why: durability & transactional guarantees if billing or credits involved.

	2.	Use Outbox pattern (write event into outbox table in same NewSQL transaction), then publish to Kafka.
	3.	Kafka consumers asynchronously update multiple downstream systems:
	•	Cassandra: append event to partition user_id=u123 for fast per-user feed:

INSERT INTO user_activity_by_user (user_id, activity_time, movie_id, action)
VALUES ('u123', '2025-10-02T21:10:00Z', 'm101','watch');

Partition key: user_id; clustering by activity_time DESC.

	•	ClickHouse: insert into movie_watch_events for analytics:

INSERT INTO movie_watch_events (movie_id, user_id, watched_at, duration) VALUES (...)

(Optimized for fast aggregation like views per hour.)

	•	Elasticsearch: optionally update movie popularity score / facets or index new comment.
	•	Redis: increment counters and leaderboards:

INCR movie:views:m101
ZINCRBY leaderboard:views 1 m101


	•	TimescaleDB / Influx: push QoS metrics (if watching implies metrics like buffering); or push streaming metrics to monitoring.
	•	Data Lake (S3): sink raw event for archival & ML.

Why this multi-write?
•	Each DB handles a storage+query pattern: Cassandra for per-user activity feed (low-latency reads), ClickHouse for analytics, Redis for counters, NewSQL for authoritative data.

Read example: “Show movie page for m101” (pulls from multiple DBs)
1.	SQL: fetch canonical movie metadata (title, release date, licensing):

SELECT movie_id, title, synopsis, release_year FROM movies WHERE movie_id='m101';


	2.	S3 (object store): get streaming URL for the video (signed URL).
	3.	Redis: read view count (fast):

GET movie:views:m101


	4.	ClickHouse: compute rolling aggregate “views last 24h”:

SELECT count() FROM movie_watch_events WHERE movie_id='m101' AND watched_at >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY;


	5.	Elasticsearch: retrieve related content (search by tags).
	6.	Graph DB: show “friends who watched this” by traversing User -[:FOLLOWS]-> Friend and Friend -[:WATCHED]-> m101:

MATCH (u:User {id:'u123'})-[:FOLLOWS]->(f)-[:WATCHED]->(m:Movie {id:'m101'})
RETURN f.name LIMIT 10;



All aggregated and rendered in UI.

⸻

B. User searches for “space thriller similar to Inception”

Flow uses Search + Vector DB + SQL + Graph recommendations
1.	UI Query: user types text → app calls search API.
2.	Elasticsearch handles keyword/autocomplete and returns candidates (by title, tags):

POST /movies/_search { "query": { "match": {"title":"space thriller"} } }


	3.	Vector DB does semantic search on embeddings for the query (finds movies whose plot embeddings are close):
	•	Convert query → embedding (LLM or embedding model).
	•	Query Pinecone:

index.query(vector=query_vec, top_k=5, include_metadata=True)


	4.	Merge results: take union of ES + Vector results, remove duplicates, rank with signals:
	•	Boost movies with high recent engagement (ClickHouse), or watched by your friends (Graph DB).
	5.	For each candidate, fetch canonical metadata from SQL or Document DB to show details and streaming URL.

Why both ES and Vector DB?
•	ES: great for keyword matches, facets (genre, year), and speed.
•	Vector DB: handles fuzzy semantic matches when the user expresses intent not matched by keywords.

⸻

C. Personalized “People You Should Follow” (Graph-heavy)

Feature needs multi-hop traversal and ranking by mutual friends and shared interests.
1.	Graph DB stores (:User)-[:FOLLOWS]->(:User) and (:User)-[:LIKES]->(:Tag) edges.
2.	Query for friends-of-friends not followed by user u123:

MATCH (u:User {id:'u123'})-[:FOLLOWS]->(f)-[:FOLLOWS]->(fof)
WHERE NOT (u)-[:FOLLOWS]->(fof) AND u <> fof
RETURN fof, COUNT(*) AS mutual
ORDER BY mutual DESC
LIMIT 10;


	3.	Augment with interest similarity:
	•	Get shared liked tags from Graph DB or Document DB (user profiles) and boost ranking.
	4.	Show suggestions; when user clicks Follow, write is processed by NewSQL (transactional) and the Graph DB is updated (via event consumer).

⸻

Schemas & sample queries per DB type

Below I give a minimal sample schema and a representative query per DB type used in our app.

⸻

1) Relational / NewSQL (Postgres / Spanner / CockroachDB)

Use: Billing, subscriptions, authoritative tables.

DDL (Postgres-like)

CREATE TABLE users (
user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
email TEXT UNIQUE,
name TEXT,
created_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE subscriptions (
sub_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
user_id UUID REFERENCES users(user_id),
plan TEXT,
status TEXT,
started_at TIMESTAMP,
expires_at TIMESTAMP
);

Query:

SELECT u.name, s.plan, s.status
FROM users u JOIN subscriptions s ON u.user_id = s.user_id
WHERE u.user_id = 'u123';


⸻

2) In-memory (Redis)

Use: Sessions, token store, counters, leaderboards.

Commands:

SET session:u123 <session_json> EX 3600
INCR movie:views:m101
ZINCRBY leaderboard:views 1 m101
GET movie:views:m101


⸻

3) Document DB (MongoDB)

Use: posts, comments, flexible metadata (multiple attachments).

Example document:

{
"_id":"p999",
"user_id":"u123",
"title":"Trailer Reaction",
"body":"Loved the trailer!",
"attachments":[{"type":"video","url":"s3://..."}],
"tags":["trailer","sci-fi"],
"created_at":"2025-10-02T20:00:00Z"
}

Query:

db.posts.find({ tags: "trailer" }).sort({created_at:-1}).limit(10)


⸻

4) Wide-Column Store (Cassandra)

Use: per-user activity feed (write-heavy, partitioned reads).

Table (CQL):

CREATE TABLE user_activity_by_user (
user_id text,
activity_time timestamp,
activity_type text,
movie_id text,
details text,
PRIMARY KEY (user_id, activity_time)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (activity_time DESC);

Query:

SELECT * FROM user_activity_by_user WHERE user_id='u123' LIMIT 50;


⸻

5) True Column Store (ClickHouse / OLAP)

Use: analytics, dashboards, ad-hoc reports.

Table (ClickHouse):

CREATE TABLE movie_watch_events (
movie_id String,
user_id String,
watched_at DateTime,
duration UInt32
) ENGINE = MergeTree()
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(watched_at)
ORDER BY (movie_id, watched_at);

Query:

SELECT movie_id, count() AS views
FROM movie_watch_events
WHERE watched_at >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY
GROUP BY movie_id
ORDER BY views DESC
LIMIT 10;


⸻

6) Graph DB (Neo4j)

Use: social graph, recommendations.

Create nodes / edges:

CREATE (u:User {id:'u123', name:'Alice'});
CREATE (v:User {id:'u456', name:'Bob'});
CREATE (u)-[:FOLLOWS {since:'2021-01-01'}]->(v);

Query: mutual-friend suggestions (shown earlier).

⸻

7) Time-Series DB (TimescaleDB / InfluxDB)

Use: metrics (buffering count, bitrates).

Timescale SQL:

CREATE TABLE streaming_metrics (
time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
region TEXT,
movie_id TEXT,
buffering_count INT,
avg_bitrate DOUBLE
);
SELECT create_hypertable('streaming_metrics','time');

-- Query: avg buffering per minute
SELECT time_bucket('1m', time) as minute, avg(buffering_count)
FROM streaming_metrics
WHERE movie_id='m101' AND time > now() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY minute;


⸻

8) Search Engine (Elasticsearch)

Use: title / caption / comments full-text search, facets.

Index doc sample:

PUT /movies/_doc/m101
{
"movie_id":"m101",
"title":"Inception",
"synopsis":"A mind-bending thriller about dreams...",
"tags":["sci-fi","thriller"],
"release_year":2010
}

Search:

GET /movies/_search
{ "query": { "match": { "synopsis": "dream heist" } } }


⸻

9) Multi-Model DB (ArangoDB / Cosmos)

Use: when you prefer a single engine for doc+graph queries (optional).
•	Store user documents, post documents and store edges Likes, FOLLOWS in edge collections allowing hybrid AQL queries.

⸻

10) Vector DB (Pinecone / Milvus / Chroma)

Use: semantic search, RAG for help articles, video caption matching.

Store:

{
"id":"doc_chunk_42",
"vector":[0.12,-0.98,...],
"metadata":{"text":"How to return a product","source":"faq"}
}

Query:

index.query(vector=query_vec, top_k=5, include_metadata=True)


⸻

11) Data Lake + Lakehouse (S3 + Delta Lake) & Big Data (Spark, Hive)

Use: raw event archival, feature engineering, model training.
•	Raw events: s3://streamshop/raw/events/2025/10/02/event_123.json
•	ETL job (Spark) transforms raw JSON → Delta Parquet tables → pushed to Lakehouse.
•	ML pipeline trains recommendation model on many months of raw data.

⸻

12) Cloud Data Warehouse (Snowflake / BigQuery)

Use: BI reporting & ad-hoc analytics for executives.

Example query:

SELECT region, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as active_users
FROM analytics.movie_watch_events
WHERE watched_at BETWEEN '2025-09-01' AND '2025-09-30'
GROUP BY region;


⸻

Why not store everything in a single DB?

Short answers tied to StreamShop:
•	Videos & large blobs: object storage (S3). Storing binaries in DBs is costly and slows indexes.
•	Full-text search: ES is optimized with inverted index and scoring; SQL LIKE or document DB text indexes are weaker.
•	High-write user activity: Cassandra handles huge concurrent writes and partitions by user; SQL struggles at scale.
•	Time-window analytics: ClickHouse / OLAP read fewer columns, compresses well → much faster for aggregations than row stores.
•	Semantic search (RAG) needs vector ANN indexes; SQL/ES can’t do speed/scale or approximate NN well.
•	Real-time counters / TTL: Redis wins for speed & TTL semantics.

So each DB is chosen because it’s the best tool for the specific access pattern.

⸻

Example: “Show me my personalized homepage” — multi-DB read flow
1.	Auth & session: check Redis session token.
2.	User profile: fetch from SQL or Document DB.
3.	Followed creators’ recent posts: read per-user activity from Cassandra (fast partition read).
4.	Attach post content: fetch post bodies/attachments metadata from MongoDB; media URL from S3.
5.	Enrich posts:
•	view counts from Redis counter
•	trending score from ClickHouse
•	search highlights from Elasticsearch if user searched
6.	Personalized inserts: recommendations from Graph DB (friends-of-friends) and from ML recommender (model trained on Lakehouse, served via vector DB or feature store).
7.	Render UI.

⸻

Practical tips & best practices
•	Outbox + Event Bus (Kafka) for eventual consistency and decoupling writes from downstream systems.
•	Schema-on-read in Data Lake — keep raw events for future unknown needs.
•	Use a single source of truth for authoritative data (NewSQL / RDBMS) and use other DBs as derived stores.
•	Materialized views: precompute heavy aggregations in ClickHouse / DWH for dashboard speed.
•	TTL / retention policies: metrics in TSDB often expire; archival goes to Data Lake.
•	Monitoring: use TSDB + dashboards to track system health (Prometheus + Grafana).

⸻

Quick revision checklist (for learners)
•	If you need ACID + relational joins → use RDBMS / NewSQL.
•	If you need ultra-fast ephemeral reads & counters → use Redis / Memcached.
•	If you need flexible JSON docs → use MongoDB / Document DB.
•	If you need massive high-write per-user timelines → Cassandra (wide-column).
•	If you need OLAP aggregations → ClickHouse / BigQuery / Redshift.
•	If you need multi-hop relationship queries → Graph DB (Neo4j).
•	If you need time-window metric queries & retention → TSDB.
•	If you need text search → Elasticsearch/Solr.
•	If you need semantic similarity / RAG → Vector DB.
•	If you need cheap raw storage & ML training → Data Lake (S3 + Delta Lake).
•	If you need batch & big-data ETL / ML → Spark / Hadoop / Hive.
•	If you need enterprise BI / ad-hoc analyst SQL → Snowflake / BigQuery.

⸻

If you’d like, next I can:
•	Produce a sequence diagram (API → outbox → Kafka → consumers) or
•	Implement a small Python demo: receive a watch event, write to SQLite (simulate RDBMS), push to Kafka (simulated), and show downstream writes to local ClickHouse / Elastic / Redis mocks, or
•	Give a concise one-page cheat sheet you can print for interviews.

Which would help you most next?
