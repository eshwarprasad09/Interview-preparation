Got it üëç Let‚Äôs dive deep into NewSQL Databases (with Google Spanner and CockroachDB as examples).

‚∏ª

üìå NewSQL Databases

1. Types & Category
   ‚Ä¢	Category: Relational + Distributed (Hybrid)
   ‚Ä¢	Type: NewSQL database
   ‚Ä¢	Combines:
   ‚Ä¢	SQL (Relational model + ACID transactions) from traditional RDBMS
   ‚Ä¢	Horizontal scalability + fault tolerance from NoSQL

üëâ In short: They give SQL‚Äôs consistency + NoSQL‚Äôs scalability.

2. Usage by Companies

üîπ Google Spanner
‚Ä¢	Company: Google
‚Ä¢	Use case: Runs mission-critical systems like:
‚Ä¢	Google Ads (billions of ad transactions/day)
‚Ä¢	Google Play Store purchases
‚Ä¢	Google Cloud Spanner (offered as a service)

It ensures global consistency with low latency using Google‚Äôs TrueTime API (atomic clocks + GPS clocks).

üîπ CockroachDB
‚Ä¢	Company: Cockroach Labs (used by companies like DoorDash, Comcast, and Baidu)
‚Ä¢	Use case:
‚Ä¢	DoorDash: Handles real-time order placements and deliveries across cities with high availability.
‚Ä¢	Comcast: Customer data + streaming usage analytics with always-on performance.

3. Schema / Data Storage Representation
   ‚Ä¢	Similar to relational DB (tables, rows, columns).
   ‚Ä¢	Schema is relational ‚Üí you define tables with columns & constraints (just like SQL).
   ‚Ä¢	But internally:
   ‚Ä¢	Data is stored in key-value ranges (like NoSQL).
   ‚Ä¢	Partitioned automatically based on primary key ranges (sharding).
   ‚Ä¢	Distributed across multiple nodes for availability & scaling.

Example (Table Creation in Spanner / CockroachDB):

CREATE TABLE Users (
user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
name STRING(100),
email STRING(255) UNIQUE,
created_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
user_id INT,
amount DECIMAL(10,2),
created_at TIMESTAMP,
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id)
);

‚úÖ Looks like a SQL schema, but runs distributed & globally consistent.

4. Complex Data Example

Imagine a global e-commerce platform (like Amazon).
‚Ä¢	Users: millions worldwide
‚Ä¢	Orders: billions/year
‚Ä¢	Inventory: across multiple warehouses

Storage in NewSQL:
‚Ä¢	Users Table (partitioned by user_id ‚Üí spreads across regions).
‚Ä¢	Orders Table (partitioned by order_id ‚Üí distributed).
‚Ä¢	Inventory Table (partitioned by product_id).

üìå Why? ‚Üí So that no single node is overloaded. Data is automatically sharded + replicated globally.

Retrieval:
‚Ä¢	Query: SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE user_id = 123;
‚Ä¢	DB looks at partitioned ranges ‚Üí finds the right shard ‚Üí retrieves in milliseconds.

5. Comparison with Other Databases

Feature	SQL (MySQL, Postgres)	NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra)	NewSQL (Spanner, CockroachDB)
Data Model	Relational (tables)	Document/Key-Value/Wide-Column	Relational (tables)
Consistency (ACID)	‚úÖ Strong	‚ùå Weak/Eventual	‚úÖ Strong (Distributed ACID)
Scalability	‚ùå Vertical only	‚úÖ Horizontal	‚úÖ Horizontal
Global Distribution	‚ùå Limited	‚úÖ Good	‚úÖ Best (automatic & consistent)
Query Language	SQL	Custom APIs / JSON Query	SQL
Best For	Small-medium apps	Big data, analytics, IoT	Global, real-time, transactional apps


‚∏ª

6. Query Execution Internals
   ‚Ä¢	Uses MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) for transactions.
   ‚Ä¢	Relies on consensus protocols (Paxos, Raft) to maintain global consistency.
   ‚Ä¢	Google Spanner ‚Üí TrueTime API: Combines atomic clocks + GPS satellites to guarantee global ordering of transactions.

‚∏ª

7. Scaling Techniques
   ‚Ä¢	Horizontal scaling: Nodes are added dynamically.
   ‚Ä¢	Data is partitioned automatically based on primary keys.
   ‚Ä¢	Transactions are distributed across nodes with consensus.

‚∏ª

8. Replication & Failover
   ‚Ä¢	Replication: Multi-region replication (synchronous or near-synchronous).
   ‚Ä¢	Failover: If a leader node fails, Raft/Paxos elects a new leader automatically.
   ‚Ä¢	Ensures zero downtime.

‚∏ª

9. Data Sync Mechanism
   ‚Ä¢	Synchronous replication for strong consistency (writes confirmed across majority before commit).
   ‚Ä¢	Asynchronous replication for read scalability in some cases.

‚∏ª

10. Business Use Cases
    ‚Ä¢	Google Spanner: Ads, Play Store, global services (billions of transactions/day).
    ‚Ä¢	DoorDash (CockroachDB): Low-latency global delivery system.
    ‚Ä¢	Comcast: Always-on customer data services.

üëâ Business Advantage:
‚Ä¢	Can serve millions of global users with:
‚Ä¢	Strong consistency
‚Ä¢	High availability
‚Ä¢	Low latency

11. Python Code Example

import psycopg2

# Connect to CockroachDB (Postgres driver works since CockroachDB uses SQL)
conn = psycopg2.connect(
dbname="bank",
user="root",
password="",
host="localhost",
port=26257
)
cur = conn.cursor()

# Create table
cur.execute("""
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Accounts (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name STRING,
balance DECIMAL
);
""")

# Insert data
cur.execute("INSERT INTO Accounts (name, balance) VALUES ('Alice', 1000.00)")
cur.execute("INSERT INTO Accounts (name, balance) VALUES ('Bob', 500.00)")

# Query data
cur.execute("SELECT * FROM Accounts")
rows = cur.fetchall()
for row in rows:
print(row)

conn.commit()
cur.close()
conn.close()

12. Revision Summary
    ‚Ä¢	Type: NewSQL (Relational + Distributed).
    ‚Ä¢	Storage Model: Tables (like SQL) but distributed across nodes.
    ‚Ä¢	Query Execution: Uses MVCC, Raft/Paxos, TrueTime (Spanner).
    ‚Ä¢	Scaling: Horizontal (automatic sharding).
    ‚Ä¢	Replication: Multi-region, synchronous for strong consistency.
    ‚Ä¢	Data Sync: Consensus protocols ensure sync.
    ‚Ä¢	Business Use: Global-scale apps (Ads, e-commerce, delivery systems).
    ‚Ä¢	Comparison: Strong consistency (better than NoSQL), scalability (better than SQL).
    ‚Ä¢	Best For: Mission-critical, globally distributed applications needing ACID + scale.

üëâ Would you like me to make a real-world LinkedIn-style case study (like we did for Graph DB) to explain how LinkedIn posts + reactions + comments could be modeled in NewSQL (Spanner/CockroachDB) for clarity?
