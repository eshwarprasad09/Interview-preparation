Great question üëç ‚Äî now we‚Äôre moving to True Column Stores (like Apache HBase, Amazon Redshift, Apache Parquet, ClickHouse, Vertica, Snowflake), which are often used for Analytical / OLAP workloads.

Let me give you a revision-style explanation like we did for Cassandra.

‚∏ª

üìò Notes: True Column Stores (Analytical OLAP)

‚∏ª

1. Type & Category
   ‚Ä¢	Category: Analytical Database (OLAP).
   ‚Ä¢	Type: Column-Oriented (True Column Store).
   ‚Ä¢	Examples: Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, ClickHouse, Apache Parquet, Vertica.
   ‚Ä¢	Different from:
   ‚Ä¢	Row-oriented (SQL, Cassandra).
   ‚Ä¢	Document-oriented (MongoDB).
   ‚Ä¢	Key-value stores (Redis, DynamoDB).

‚∏ª

2. Why Columnar Storage?
   ‚Ä¢	In OLTP (row store, e.g., MySQL) ‚Üí data stored row by row.
   ‚Ä¢	In OLAP (column store, e.g., Redshift, ClickHouse) ‚Üí data stored column by column.

üëâ This makes aggregations, scans, analytics much faster.
üëâ Instead of reading entire rows, only needed columns are read.

‚∏ª

3. Schema Creation (DDL Example in Redshift / ClickHouse)

-- Example: Netflix user watch history analytics
CREATE TABLE user_watch_history (
user_id       BIGINT,
movie_id      INT,
watch_time    TIMESTAMP,
duration_sec  INT,
device        VARCHAR(20),
location      VARCHAR(50),
rating        INT
)
-- Redshift stores in columnar format by default
DISTSTYLE KEY
DISTKEY(user_id)
SORTKEY(movie_id, watch_time);


‚∏ª

4. Example Data (Rich Dataset)

user_id	movie_id	watch_time	duration_sec	device	location	rating
1111	101	2025-10-01 10:00:00	300	Mobile	Bangalore	5
1111	102	2025-10-01 11:00:00	120	Laptop	Bangalore	NULL
2222	101	2025-10-01 10:05:00	150	SmartTV	Delhi	4
3333	103	2025-10-01 09:50:00	200	Mobile	Mumbai	3


‚∏ª

5. How Data is Stored Internally

Instead of storing row by row, columns are stored separately:

user_id:    [1111, 1111, 2222, 3333]
movie_id:   [101, 102, 101, 103]
watch_time: [2025-10-01 10:00, 2025-10-01 11:00, 2025-10-01 10:05, 2025-10-01 09:50]
duration:   [300, 120, 150, 200]
device:     [Mobile, Laptop, SmartTV, Mobile]
location:   [Bangalore, Bangalore, Delhi, Mumbai]
rating:     [5, NULL, 4, 3]

‚úÖ Each column is compressed (e.g., location has repeated ‚ÄúBangalore‚Äù ‚Üí dictionary encoding).
‚úÖ Queries only scan relevant columns, not full rows.

‚∏ª

6. Query Examples

Find average rating per movie

SELECT movie_id, AVG(rating)
FROM user_watch_history
GROUP BY movie_id;

üëâ Reads only movie_id + rating column ‚Üí skips others ‚Üí huge speed-up.

‚∏ª

Find total watch time by location

SELECT location, SUM(duration_sec)
FROM user_watch_history
GROUP BY location;

üëâ Reads only location + duration_sec columns.

‚∏ª

7. Why Column Stores are Fast
   ‚Ä¢	Compression: Each column often has repeating values (e.g., location = ‚ÄúBangalore‚Äù) ‚Üí easily compressed.
   ‚Ä¢	Vectorized Execution: Operations run on compressed blocks (SIMD).
   ‚Ä¢	I/O Efficiency: Only required columns scanned.
   ‚Ä¢	Batch Analytics: Perfect for OLAP queries scanning billions of rows.

8. Comparison with Row Stores (SQL, Cassandra, MongoDB)

Feature / DB	Column Store (Redshift, ClickHouse)	Row Store (SQL, Cassandra)	Document (MongoDB)
Best For	Analytics, aggregations, BI, OLAP	Transactions, OLTP	Semi-structured, JSON
Data Stored	Column-wise (user_id[], movie_id[], ‚Ä¶)	Row-wise (each record complete)	JSON docs
Query	Reads only needed columns	Reads whole rows (even unused cols)	Reads full JSON docs
Speed	Super fast for SUM, AVG, GROUP BY	Slower for aggregations	Slower for deep scans
Compression	Very high (columnar encoding)	Low (row storage)	Medium (BSON)
Weakness	Bad at real-time updates (writes expensive)	Great at high writes	Great for flexibility


‚∏ª

9. Scaling Techniques
   ‚Ä¢	Vertical Scaling: Add more CPU/RAM (limited).
   ‚Ä¢	Horizontal Scaling: Shard by column partitions across nodes.
   ‚Ä¢	Examples:
   ‚Ä¢	Redshift distributes by DISTKEY/SORTKEY.
   ‚Ä¢	ClickHouse shards data across clusters.

‚∏ª

10. Replication & Data Sync
    ‚Ä¢	Column stores (like Redshift, Snowflake) typically use:
    ‚Ä¢	Leader-Follower Replication
    ‚Ä¢	Asynchronous replication for high availability.
    ‚Ä¢	Some (ClickHouse) use consensus protocols (like Raft/Zookeeper) for failover.

‚∏ª

11. Business Use Cases
    ‚Ä¢	Netflix: Analytics on watch patterns, recommendations (Redshift + Presto + Hive).
    ‚Ä¢	Uber: Real-time analytics (ClickHouse).
    ‚Ä¢	Amazon: Redshift for AWS customers ‚Üí BI, dashboards.
    ‚Ä¢	Google: BigQuery for ad analytics.

‚∏ª

12. Key Takeaways for Revision
    ‚Ä¢	Type: True Column Store (OLAP).
    ‚Ä¢	Storage: Column-wise, compressed.
    ‚Ä¢	Best Use Case: Aggregations, analytics, BI dashboards.
    ‚Ä¢	Query Speed: Reads only required columns ‚Üí very fast.
    ‚Ä¢	Difference from Cassandra (Wide-Column):
    ‚Ä¢	Cassandra = row store optimized for OLTP write-heavy.
    ‚Ä¢	Redshift/ClickHouse = column store optimized for OLAP read-heavy.

‚∏ª

‚ö° Quick Analogy:
‚Ä¢	Cassandra: Notebook with all activities of each user grouped together (good for transactions, logs).
‚Ä¢	Redshift / Column Store: Notebook with all user_ids on one page, all movie_ids on another page (good for analytics).

üëâ Do you want me to now prepare a side-by-side schema + query execution example for the same Netflix dataset in Cassandra vs Redshift so you can see OLTP vs OLAP difference in action?
