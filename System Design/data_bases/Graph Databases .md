üìå Graph Database ‚Äì Complete Revision Notes

‚∏ª

1Ô∏è‚É£ What is a Graph Database?
‚Ä¢	A graph database stores data as nodes (entities) and edges (relationships).
‚Ä¢	Nodes represent entities: users, movies, posts, etc.
‚Ä¢	Edges represent relationships: FOLLOWS, LIKES, WATCHED, COMMENTED_ON.
‚Ä¢	Nodes and edges can have properties (metadata).
‚Ä¢	Edges are first-class citizens, optimized for traversal and connected data queries.
‚Ä¢	Ideal for social networks, recommendation engines, fraud detection, and other multi-hop relationship data.

‚∏ª

2Ô∏è‚É£ Key Elements

Element	Description	Example
Node	Entity/object	User, Movie, Post, Hashtag
Edge/Relation	Connection between nodes	FOLLOWS, WATCHED, LIKES
Property	Metadata for node/edge	User.name=‚ÄúAlice‚Äù, timestamp=‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Äù
Label	Node type/category	:User, :Movie, :Post


‚∏ª

3Ô∏è‚É£ Why Big Tech Uses Graph DB

Company	Use Case
Facebook	Social graph: friends, likes, follows, groups
LinkedIn	Recommendations: ‚ÄúPeople you may know‚Äù using mutual connections
Twitter/X	Followers, retweets, topic-based suggestions
Netflix	Movie recommendations based on user activity & co-watch patterns
Uber	Route optimization & supply-demand graph for dynamic pricing

Reason: These applications require multi-hop traversals, like ‚Äúfriends-of-friends‚Äù or ‚Äúusers who watched the same movie,‚Äù which are expensive in SQL.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Comparison: Graph DB vs SQL / MongoDB / Cassandra

Feature	SQL	MongoDB	Cassandra	Graph DB
Relationships	Foreign keys & JOINs	Embedded docs or references	Clustering keys & lookups	Direct edges between nodes
Multi-hop queries	Expensive JOINs	Complex aggregation	Not natural	Fast edge traversal
Schema flexibility	Rigid	Flexible	Flexible	Extremely flexible
Real-time recommendations	Hard for large-scale	Aggregations required	Complex	Simple via traversal

Key takeaway: Graph DBs excel when relationships are complex and multi-hop queries are common.

‚∏ª

5Ô∏è‚É£ Example 1: Netflix User Activity

Schema
‚Ä¢	Nodes: User, Movie
‚Ä¢	Edge: WATCHED (User ‚Üí Movie)
‚Ä¢	Properties: timestamp, action

Example Data

Alice -[:WATCHED {timestamp:"2025-10-01 10:00", rating:5}]-> Movie:Inception
Bob   -[:WATCHED {timestamp:"2025-10-01 11:00", rating:4}]-> Movie:Inception
Charlie -[:WATCHED {timestamp:"2025-10-01 12:00", rating:5}]-> Movie:Interstellar

Query Examples

1. Users who watched a specific movie

MATCH (u:User)-[:WATCHED]->(m:Movie {title:"Inception"})
RETURN u.name

2. Recommend movies based on co-watch

MATCH (u:User {name:"Alice"})-[:WATCHED]->(m:Movie)<-[:WATCHED]-(other:User)-[:WATCHED]->(rec:Movie)
WHERE NOT (u)-[:WATCHED]->(rec)
RETURN rec.title AS recommended_movie, COUNT(DISTINCT other) AS popularity
ORDER BY popularity DESC


‚∏ª

6Ô∏è‚É£ Example 2: Social Media (LinkedIn / Facebook)

Entities (Nodes)
‚Ä¢	User: {id, name, age, location}
‚Ä¢	Post: {post_id, timestamp, minimal metadata}
‚Ä¢	Hashtag (optional): {name}

Relationships (Edges)
‚Ä¢	FOLLOWS: User ‚Üí User
‚Ä¢	LIKES: User ‚Üí Post
‚Ä¢	COMMENTED_ON: User ‚Üí Post
‚Ä¢	CREATED: User ‚Üí Post
‚Ä¢	TAGGED: Post ‚Üí Hashtag

Hybrid Storage Approach
‚Ä¢	Post content (text, image, video) ‚Üí SQL or object storage (S3, Blob)
‚Ä¢	Post node in Graph DB ‚Üí lightweight: post_id, timestamp
‚Ä¢	Edges represent likes, comments, creations

Example

Alice -[:CREATED]-> Post:P101
Bob   -[:LIKES]-> Post:P101
Charlie -[:COMMENTED_ON]-> Post:P101

Query Examples

1. Users who liked a post

MATCH (p:Post {post_id:"P101"})<-[:LIKES]-(u:User)
RETURN u.name

2. Recommend people to follow (mutual friends)

MATCH (u:User {name:"Alice"})-[:FOLLOWS]->(friend)-[:FOLLOWS]->(fof)
WHERE NOT (u)-[:FOLLOWS]->(fof) AND u <> fof
RETURN fof.name AS recommended_user, COUNT(*) AS mutual_friends
ORDER BY mutual_friends DESC

3. Recommend users based on same movies watched

MATCH (u:User {name:"Alice"})-[:WATCHED]->(m:Movie)<-[:WATCHED]-(other:User)
WHERE u <> other
RETURN other.name AS recommended_user, COUNT(DISTINCT m) AS common_movies
ORDER BY common_movies DESC

7Ô∏è‚É£ Python Example to Save Data

from neo4j import GraphDatabase

driver = GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", auth=("neo4j","password"))

def create_user(user_id, name):
with driver.session() as session:
session.run("MERGE (u:User {id:$id}) SET u.name=$name", id=user_id, name=name)

def create_post(post_id, user_id):
with driver.session() as session:
session.run("""
MATCH (u:User {id:$uid})
MERGE (p:Post {post_id:$pid})
MERGE (u)-[:CREATED]->(p)
""", uid=user_id, pid=post_id)

def create_like(user_id, post_id):
with driver.session() as session:
session.run("""
MATCH (u:User {id:$uid})
MATCH (p:Post {post_id:$pid})
MERGE (u)-[:LIKES]->(p)
""", uid=user_id, pid=post_id)

8Ô∏è‚É£ Key Advantages of Graph DB
1.	Efficient multi-hop traversal ‚Äì friends-of-friends, co-watch, like recommendations
2.	Flexible schema ‚Äì add new relationship types anytime
3.	Direct relationship queries ‚Äì no expensive JOINs
4.	Hybrid approach for heavy data ‚Äì store large media in SQL/object storage, keep edges in Graph DB
5.	Used in production by tech giants ‚Äì Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Netflix, Uber

9Ô∏è‚É£ Revision Summary Table

Topic	Key Point
Type	NoSQL, graph database
Data structure	Nodes + Edges with properties
Multi-hop queries	Very fast via traversal, no JOINs
Schema flexibility	Extremely flexible
Hybrid storage	Graph DB for edges & relationships, SQL/Blob for heavy content

‚∏ª

If you want, I can also draw a big visual diagram showing Users, Posts, Likes, Follows, Movies, and Recommendations, so you can see exactly how all edges connect and queries work.

Do you want me to create that diagram?
