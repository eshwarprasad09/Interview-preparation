Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)
how what are the types of databases available under which company uses it for what purpose and some simple representation of
how the data stored in the database how the data is query and how database works internally to find the data and give and how
those particular database vertical and horizontally scaling how it has a read replicas and write node. If write node goes down
which technique is used to make one of the read nodes to make as a write node how the data sync will

Explain how this database is used by tech giants, and for what business purpose, how it is giving advantage

Got it üëç
You want a **generic, reusable prompt** that you (or anyone) can use to get a structured explanation for **any database technology** covering:

* Types of the database
* Which companies use it and why
* How data is stored internally
* How queries are executed
* Scaling techniques (vertical, horizontal)
* Replication (read replicas, write node, failover handling)
* Syncing between nodes
* Business use cases by tech giants
* Competitive advantages

Here‚Äôs a well-structured **universal prompt** you can use üëá

Got it! Here‚Äôs your **original prompt**, enhanced with the extra points you requested about **schema/table creation, data storage, retrieval, and thought process**:

---

Got it! Here's your **fully enhanced prompt** with the new point added for **complex data examples and detailed lookup explanations**, along with all the previous points:

### **Prompt: Explain the database system [Database Name] in detail**

Explain the database system `[Database Name]` in detail with the following points:

1. **Types & Category** ‚Äì What type of database it is (relational, NoSQL, key-value, document, wide-column, graph, time-series, NewSQL, in-memory, multi-model, etc.).

2. **Usage by Companies** ‚Äì Which companies/tech giants use this database, and for what exact purpose (with real examples like Amazon, Netflix, Uber, Google, etc.).

3. **Schema / Table Creation & Data Storage Representation**

    * How **tables, collections, or column families** are created.
    * Show **how data is stored internally** (rows, columns, documents, partitions, indexes, column families, clustering, etc.).
    * Include a **diagram or structured explanation** to make it easy to understand.
    * Explain **how the database retrieves the data** internally.
    * Discuss the **thought process behind designing the schema** and storing data in this way (why this structure is chosen, how it helps with queries and performance).

4. **Complex Data Example**

    * Provide a **very complex, real-world dataset example** that covers multiple scenarios (nested structures, time-series, multi-attributes, variable schema, relationships, etc.).
    * Explain **how this data is stored internally**, **how lookups and queries are performed**, and **how retrieval is optimized**.
    * Include diagrams or structured representation to give a **clear picture of data flow**.

5. **Example Comparison with Other Database Systems**

    * Show a **side-by-side comparison** with other database systems (SQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc.).
    * Include **example data storage representation** in this database versus other database types.
    * Explain the **advantages of using this database system over others** for certain use cases (e.g., write-heavy, analytics, real-time, flexible schema, low latency).
    * Use tables or diagrams for clarity.

6. **Query Execution** ‚Äì How queries work internally (e.g., indexes, partitioning, B-Trees, LSM Trees). Include example queries to demonstrate data retrieval.

7. **Scaling Techniques** ‚Äì Explain vertical scaling vs. horizontal scaling for this database, and how it is achieved.

8. **Replication & Failover** ‚Äì How read replicas and write nodes work. What happens if the write node fails? Which technique (e.g., leader election, Raft, Paxos, Zookeeper, etc.) is used to promote a read node to a write node.

9. **Data Sync Mechanism** ‚Äì How data is synchronized between the write node and read replicas (asynchronous vs. synchronous replication).

10. **Business Use Cases** ‚Äì How tech giants use this database in their ecosystem and what business advantage it provides (e.g., scalability for millions of users, low latency for recommendations, real-time analytics, etc.).

11. **Python Code Example** ‚Äì Write a simple Python code example for creating tables/collections, inserting data, and querying it, with comments explaining each step.

12. **Revision Summary** ‚Äì Provide bullet points summarizing the key aspects: type, storage model, query execution, scaling, replication, data sync, business use cases, **comparative advantages over other database systems**, and **complex data handling & retrieval process**.

---

This prompt now **fully covers everything**, including:

* Schema/table creation
* Data storage and retrieval
* Thought process for schema design
* Complex data examples and lookup explanation
* Comparison with other databases
* Business use cases and Python examples

---

If you want, I can now **convert this into a ready-to-use MD template** that you can fill for any database, including **complex dataset examples, diagrams, Python code, and comparisons**.

Do you want me to create that next?

---

üëâ With this prompt, you can just replace **[Database Name]** with *MySQL, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, MongoDB, DynamoDB, Redis, etc.* and get a full structured explanation.

Would you like me to **apply this prompt right now to Cassandra** (since you mentioned it earlier), so you can see how it works in practice?
