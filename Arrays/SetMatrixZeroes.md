# ✅ Set Matrix Zeroes - Step-by-Step Explanation (Java Solution)

## 🔍 Problem Statement (Leetcode 73: Set Matrix Zeroes)

> Given an `m x n` matrix, if an element is 0, **set its entire row and column to 0**.  
> You must do it **in-place** (i.e., with **O(1)** additional space).

---

## 🧠 How to Approach This Problem (Intuition)

### Step 1: Understand the Core Operation
- The key operation: if any element is 0, **the entire row and column of that element must become 0**.

---

### Step 2: Naive Approach (Extra Space)

- Traverse matrix and **store rows and columns** that have 0.
- Then, traverse again and **set cells in those rows and columns to 0**.

```text
Time Complexity: O(m * n)
Space Complexity: O(m + n)

### Step 3: Optimal Approach (O(1) Space)

#### Key Idea:

Use the **first row and first column** as storage to **mark** whether the rest of the row/column should be zeroed.

## ✅ Java Code with Step-by-Step Explanation

```java
class Solution {
    public void setZeroes(int[][] matrix) {
        int m = matrix.length, n = matrix[0].length;

        // Step 0: Flags to remember if the first row or first column needs to be zeroed
        boolean isRow0 = false, isCol0 = false;

        // Step 1: Check if first row has any 0
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (matrix[0][i] == 0)
                isRow0 = true;
        }

        // Step 2: Check if first column has any 0
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            if (matrix[i][0] == 0)
                isCol0 = true;
        }

        // Step 3: Use first row & column to mark rows and columns that should be zeroed
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == 0) {
                    matrix[i][0] = 0; // mark the row
                    matrix[0][j] = 0; // mark the column
                }
            }
        }

        // Step 4: Set cells to 0 based on marks (excluding first row and column)
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (matrix[i][0] == 0 || matrix[0][j] == 0)
                    matrix[i][j] = 0;
            }
        }

        // Step 5: Update the first row if it had any 0
        if (isRow0) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                matrix[0][j] = 0;
        }

        // Step 6: Update the first column if it had any 0
        if (isCol0) {
            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
                matrix[i][0] = 0;
        }
    }
}
```

## 💡 Concepts & Patterns Used

| Concept            | Description                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| In-place update    | No extra space; modify original matrix directly                          |
| Flagging           | Used `isRow0` and `isCol0` to track changes in the first row/column      |
| Space optimization | Matrix itself is used for tracking zero rows/columns, saving extra space |
| Matrix traversal   | Standard `O(m * n)` double-loop for processing all elements              |
| Two-pass approach  | First pass to mark, second to update the matrix                          |

## 🔎 How to Identify the Pattern / Choose the Algorithm

| Question to Ask                                 | Pattern to Apply                               |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Is the matrix being modified in-place?          | Use the matrix itself to store flags           |
| Do we need to avoid extra space?                | Use first row/column as markers                |
| Can we defer updates till later?                | Mark first → update later (delayed update)     |
| Is the problem about transforming rows/columns? | Think in terms of **row/column marking logic** |

## 🧠 Summary in Bullet Points (Quick Revision)

* ✅ If `matrix[i][j] == 0`, mark its row and column for zeroing.
* ✅ Reuse `matrix[i][0]` and `matrix[0][j]` to store the flags.
* ✅ Use `isRow0` and `isCol0` to remember if the first row or column needs zeroing.
* ✅ Time Complexity: `O(m * n)`
* ✅ Space Complexity: `O(1)` (no additional space used)
* ✅ Carefully handle the first row and column **after** other rows/columns are processed.
