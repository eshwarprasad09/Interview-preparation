# 🔁 Rotate Array by K Steps — In-Place Using Reversal

---

## 🧩 Problem

> Given an integer array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

Example:

```
Input:  nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3  
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```

---

## 💡 Intuition

Instead of rotating each element one-by-one (which is inefficient), we can think of the array as **two parts that we rearrange**. We use **reversals** to shift the elements efficiently.

The trick is:

1. Reverse the **whole array**.
2. Reverse the **first `k` elements**.
3. Reverse the **remaining `n - k` elements**.

This results in the rotated array without using extra space.

## 🔍 Pattern Identification & Strategy

### How to Identify the Pattern:

| Clue from Problem         | Pattern                                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Rotate right by `k` steps | **Array manipulation**                            |
| In-place                  | Avoid using extra arrays → use **reversal**       |
| Optimize time complexity  | Avoid brute force → look for **math-based trick** |

### Breakdown:

1. When rotating, elements **wrap around** the end.
2. A rotate-right by `k` is the same as taking the **last `k` elements** and putting them in front.
3. To do this efficiently without using extra space, we **reverse the array in sections**.

| Concept / Pattern    | Usage                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Array Reversal       | Efficient in-place rotation                |
| Modulo Operation     | Normalize `k` if greater than array length |
| Two-pointer Swapping | Used in `reverse()` method to swap ends    |

```java
public class Solution {
    
    // Function to rotate the array by k steps
    public static void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Normalize k in case it's greater than array length
        k %= nums.length;

        // Step 1: Reverse the whole array
        reverse(nums, 0, nums.length - 1);

        // Step 2: Reverse first k elements
        reverse(nums, 0, k - 1);

        // Step 3: Reverse the rest
        reverse(nums, k, nums.length - 1);
    }

    // Helper function to reverse elements from index start to end
    public static void reverse(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
        while (start < end) {
            // Swap the two ends
            int temp = nums[start];
            nums[start] = nums[end];
            nums[end] = temp;

            // Move towards the center
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
}
```

## 🧪 Step-by-Step Dry Run

### Input:

```java
nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
```

### Step 1: Reverse Entire Array

```java
reverse(nums, 0, 6);
Original: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
After Reverse: [7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
```

### Step 2: Reverse First k=3 Elements

```java
reverse(nums, 0, 2);
Before: [7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
After: [5,6,7,4,3,2,1]
```

### Step 3: Reverse Rest of Array (from k=3 to end)

```java
reverse(nums, 3, 6);
Before: [5,6,7,4,3,2,1]
After: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```

✅ Final Output: `[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]`

## 🧠 Real-Life Analogy

Imagine a **conveyor belt** in a factory. You want to shift all the items to the right by `k` positions, with items falling off the end coming back to the front. Instead of physically moving each item step-by-step, you simply **rotate sections** of the belt to get to the desired arrangement.

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity

| Metric               | Complexity                                      |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Time Complexity**  | `O(n)` — each element is swapped at most twice  |
| **Space Complexity** | `O(1)` — in-place rotation using constant space |

---

## 📝 Summary (Quick Revision Points)

* ✅ **Reverse-based rotation** is a classic O(n) solution.
* ➗ Use `k %= nums.length` to handle `k > n`.
* 🔁 Perform **3 reversals**:

    * Whole array
    * First `k` elements
    * Remaining `n-k` elements
* ❌ No extra array is used → space efficient.

## 📚 When to Use This Technique

Use this reversal method when:

* You need to rotate arrays in-place.
* Memory usage must be minimal.
* You want optimal time performance over brute-force approaches.
