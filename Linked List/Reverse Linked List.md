# 🔄 Reverse Linked List - Full Explanation

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list and return the new head.

### Example:

Input: `1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → null`
Output: `5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → null`

## 🧠 Intuition

In a **singly linked list**, each node only knows about the next node (`.next`). To reverse it, we need to make each node point **backwards** instead of forwards.

We can't just "go back" in a singly linked list, so we need to **traverse forward** while **reversing pointers**.

## 🧩 Concepts & Patterns Used

* **Linked List Manipulation**
* **Two/Three-Pointer Technique**
* **In-Place Reversal**
* **Iterative Approach**

---

## 🧠 How to Identify the Pattern

Look for:

* Linked list-based questions asking for reversal, reordering, or modification of `.next` pointers.
* If recursion is not required and space needs to be minimized, use **iterative pointer manipulation**.

## ✅ Step-by-Step Code Explanation

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode prev = null;     // Step 1: Previous node is initially null
        ListNode curr = head;     // Step 2: Current node starts at the head

        while (curr != null) {    // Step 3: Traverse the list
            ListNode next = curr.next;  // Step 4: Save the next node
            curr.next = prev;           // Step 5: Reverse the pointer
            prev = curr;                // Step 6: Move prev forward
            curr = next;                // Step 7: Move curr forward
        }

        return prev;    // Step 8: Return new head (prev is at the last node now)
    }
}
```

## 🧪 Step-by-Step Dry Run

Input:
`head = [1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → null]`

| Step | `curr` | `next` | `prev` (reversed part)   |
| ---- | ------ | ------ | ------------------------ |
| 1    | 1      | 2      | null                     |
| 2    | 2      | 3      | 1 → null                 |
| 3    | 3      | 4      | 2 → 1 → null             |
| 4    | 4      | 5      | 3 → 2 → 1 → null         |
| 5    | 5      | null   | 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → null     |
| 6    | null   | -      | 5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → null |

Output: `5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → null`

## 🧮 Time & Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  Traverses each node exactly once.

* **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  Reverses the list in place without using extra space.

---

## 📌 Summary (Quick Revision)

* Use 3 pointers: `prev`, `curr`, and `next`
* Iterate through the list and reverse `.next` at each step
* Return `prev` which will be the new head
* ✅ Time: O(n), ✅ Space: O(1)

---

## 💼 Real-Life Use Cases

* **Undo/Redo systems**: Tracking previous states
* **Blockchain traversal**: Reversing transaction history
* **Stack implementation** using linked lists
* **Navigation systems**: Reversing paths or commands
