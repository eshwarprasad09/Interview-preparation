# ➕ Add Two Numbers — Full Explanation

## 🔍 Problem Statement

You are given two **non-empty linked lists** representing two **non-negative integers**. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each node contains a **single digit**.
Add the two numbers and return the sum as a **linked list** (also in reverse order).

---

### 🔢 Example

**Input:**

```
l1 = 2 → 4 → 3   (represents 342)
l2 = 5 → 6 → 4   (represents 465)
```

**Output:**

```
7 → 0 → 8        (342 + 465 = 807)
```

---

## 🧠 Intuition

* The numbers are stored in **reverse order**. This allows us to simulate addition **from least significant digit to most**.
* We traverse both lists node by node, **add corresponding digits + carry**, and create a new node for each digit in the result.
* Use a **dummy head node** to simplify edge case handling.

---

## 💡 Concepts & Patterns Used

* **Linked List Traversal**
* **Digit-wise Addition**
* **Carry Propagation**
* **Dummy Head Node Pattern**
* **Simulating Elementary Addition**

---

## 🔍 How to Identify the Pattern

**Clues:**

* Addition digit-by-digit → Think of carry and column-wise addition.
* "Reverse order" → Traverse from head, not tail.
* Linked list involved → Need to simulate operations node by node.
* Building a new list → Use dummy node to avoid edge cases.

## ✅ Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode addTwoNumbers(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        // Dummy node to simplify result list creation
        ListNode dummyHead = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode curr = dummyHead;
        int carry = 0;

        // Traverse until both lists are fully processed
        while (l1 != null || l2 != null) {
            int sum = carry;

            // Add current digit from l1 if exists
            if (l1 != null) {
                sum += l1.val;
                l1 = l1.next;
            }

            // Add current digit from l2 if exists
            if (l2 != null) {
                sum += l2.val;
                l2 = l2.next;
            }

            // Create a node with the digit (sum % 10)
            curr.next = new ListNode(sum % 10);
            curr = curr.next;

            // Calculate carry for next addition
            carry = sum / 10;
        }

        // Handle leftover carry if exists
        if (carry > 0) {
            curr.next = new ListNode(carry);
        }

        // Return the real head of the result list
        return dummyHead.next;
    }
}
```

## 🔄 Step-by-Step Dry Run

### Input:

```
l1 = 2 → 4 → 3
l2 = 5 → 6 → 4
```

### Process:

```
Step 1: 2 + 5 + 0 = 7       → Node: 7, Carry: 0
Step 2: 4 + 6 + 0 = 10      → Node: 0, Carry: 1
Step 3: 3 + 4 + 1 = 8       → Node: 8, Carry: 0
```

### Output:

`7 → 0 → 8`

## 📦 Real-Life Use Case

* **Adding Big Integers**: Where numbers can't be stored in primitive data types.
* **Blockchain / Ledger Systems**: Where transactions might be handled in digit-wise chunks.
* **Custom math libraries**: Used in calculators, simulations, or embedded systems where digit-wise operations are needed.

---

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

### ✅ Time Complexity: `O(max(N, M))`

* Where N and M are lengths of `l1` and `l2`.
* Each digit is processed once.

### ✅ Space Complexity: `O(max(N, M) + 1)`

* We create a new list to store the result.
* `+1` if there's a carry left at the end.

---

## 📌 Summary (Quick Revision)

* Traverse both lists while adding digits and keeping track of carry.
* Use dummy node to avoid null pointer handling at start.
* After loop, check for leftover carry and add if present.
* Time: O(max(N, M)), Space: O(max(N, M))

---

## ✅ Bonus Tip

Avoid converting linked list to integers and back. That can lead to:

* **Overflow issues** for large numbers
* **Extra space** for string or number representation

Let me know if you want the **follow-up version** where the digits are stored **in forward order** instead of reverse.
