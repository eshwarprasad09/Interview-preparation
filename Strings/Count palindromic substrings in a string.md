Here is a complete **interview-ready breakdown** of how to solve the **Count Palindromic Substrings** problem — step-by-step with intuition, dry run, code with inline comments, and all patterns involved.

# 🔄 Count Palindromic Substrings

---

## ✅ Problem Statement

> Given a string `s`, return the total number of **palindromic substrings** in it.

* A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters.
* A **palindrome** reads the same forwards and backwards.
* Substrings with different starting or ending positions are counted **separately**.

📌 Example:

```text
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: All substrings are ["a","a","a","aa","aa","aaa"]
```

---

## 🧠 Intuition

We want to **expand around all possible centers** of the string and count how many palindromes are formed.

A palindrome can be:

* **Odd-length**: center is at a character
* **Even-length**: center is between two characters

So we need to check palindromes around **2n − 1 centers**:

* For every index `i` in the string:

    * Expand around `i` (odd-length)
    * Expand around `i and i+1` (even-length)

## 🔍 How to Identify the Pattern

| Problem Clue                       | Suggestion                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Count substrings                   | Try brute force or expansion   |
| Check for palindrome per substring | Use center expansion           |
| Optimize from `O(n³)`              | Expand Around Center → `O(n²)` |

## 🛠️ Concepts & Patterns Used

| Pattern/Concept            | Why It’s Used                       |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Expand Around Center       | Efficient way to detect palindromes |
| Dynamic Window             | Expand window while valid           |
| Two-Pointer/Sliding Window | For checking symmetry from center   |

## ✅ Java Code with Inline Comments

```java
class Solution {
    public int countSubstrings(String s) {
        int count = 0;

        // Try every center (single char and between two chars)
        for (int center = 0; center < s.length(); center++) {
            // Odd-length palindromes (center at i)
            count += expandAroundCenter(s, center, center);
            // Even-length palindromes (center between i and i+1)
            count += expandAroundCenter(s, center, center + 1);
        }

        return count;
    }

    // Expand from the center while it’s a palindrome
    private int expandAroundCenter(String s, int left, int right) {
        int count = 0;

        // Expand as long as valid and characters match
        while (left >= 0 && right < s.length() && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {
            count++;   // Found a palindrome
            left--;    // Expand to left
            right++;   // Expand to right
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

## 🔂 Step-by-Step Dry Run

Input: `"aaa"`

### All Centers:

* `i=0`: `"a"` → ✅
* `i=0,1`: `"aa"` → ✅
* `i=1`: `"a"` → ✅
* `i=1,2`: `"aa"` → ✅
* `i=2`: `"a"` → ✅
* `i=0,2`: `"aaa"` → ✅

✅ Total = `6`

## 📦 Time & Space Complexity

| Metric | Value                               |
| ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Time   | `O(n²)` — double loop via expansion |
| Space  | `O(1)` — no extra memory used       |
