# 🔍 Longest Palindromic Substring – Full Explanation

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the **longest palindromic substring** in `s`.

---

## ✅ Code: Java (Expand Around Center)

```java
class Solution {
    public String longestPalindrome(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() < 1)
            return "";

        int start = 0; // Start index of longest palindrome
        int end = 0;   // End index of longest palindrome

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            int len1 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i);       // Odd-length palindromes
            int len2 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1);   // Even-length palindromes
            int len = Math.max(len1, len2);

            if (len > end - start) {
                start = i - (len - 1) / 2; // Centered back to left
                end = i + len / 2;         // Right boundary
            }
        }

        return s.substring(start, end + 1);
    }

    private int expandAroundCenter(String s, int left, int right) {
        while (left >= 0 && right < s.length() && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {
            left--;
            right++;
        }
        return right - left - 1; // total length of palindrome
    }
}
```

## 🔍 Intuition

* A palindrome mirrors around its **center**.
* So, a palindrome can be expanded from its center and checked whether it’s valid.
* There are **2n - 1 centers** in a string of length `n`:

    * One for each character (odd-length)
    * One between each pair of characters (even-length)

## 🧠 Concepts & Patterns Used

* **Two Pointer Expansion**
* **Sliding Window / Center Expansion**
* Substring window tracking
* Dynamic window update based on expansion

---

## 🛠️ How to Identify the Pattern

* Problem is about finding **substring**
* Substring must satisfy a specific condition (being a palindrome)
* Brute-force all substrings is O(n³), too slow
* Optimization hint: **expand around center** is an efficient approach

---

## 📝 Step-by-Step Dry Run

### Input:

```java
s = "babad"
```

### Iterations:

* i = 0 → center at 'b' → expand → "b"
* i = 1 → center at 'a' → expands to "bab" → update start=0, end=2
* i = 2 → center at 'b' → expands to "aba" → still 3 chars, but same as above
* i = 3 → center at 'a' → expand → "a"
* i = 4 → center at 'd' → expand → "d"

**Result:** `"bab"` or `"aba"` — both valid palindromes of length 3

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

| Metric              | Complexity                    |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 🕒 Time Complexity  | O(n²) — expand on each center |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | O(1) — constant extra space   |

---

## 📌 Summary (Quick Revision)

* Loop over each character as potential center
* Expand from center outward while palindrome holds
* Track max length and update the start & end indices
* Return substring from `start` to `end`

---

## 🔄 Real-World Use Case

* Detect palindromic substrings in **DNA sequences**
* **Text processing**, symmetric token parsing
* Finding **symmetric user patterns** in behavioral logs
