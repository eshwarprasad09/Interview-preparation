# üß† SOLID Principles in Depth (with Examples)

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

> A class should have **only one reason to change**

### ‚ùå Anti-Pattern

```java
public class OrderService {
    void validate(Order o) {...}
    void sendEmail(Order o) {...}
    void saveToDB(Order o) {...}
}
```

### ‚úÖ Better Design

* `OrderValidator` ‚Üí validation logic
* `OrderRepository` ‚Üí DB logic
* `NotificationService` ‚Üí emails/SMS

üìå **Each class handles one responsibility** ‚Üí easier to test, change, and deploy

### ‚úÖ Real Use Case:

* OrderService in supply chain split into:

    * `OrderValidationService`
    * `OrderInventoryService`
    * `OrderNotificationService`

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

> Software entities should be **open for extension but closed for modification**

### ‚ùå Bad Code

```java
if(order.getType().equals("B2B")) {...}
else if(order.getType().equals("B2C")) {...}
```

### ‚úÖ Strategy Pattern

```java
DiscountStrategy strategy = DiscountFactory.getStrategy(order.getType());
strategy.apply(order);
```

üìå Now you can **add new strategies** (like PartnerDiscount) without touching existing logic

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

> Derived classes must be **substitutable** for their base classes

### ‚ùå Violation

```java
class ExpressShipping extends Shipping {
    public double calculateCost(Order o) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
    }
}
```

### ‚úÖ Fix

Ensure all subclasses fully implement base class behavior, or use interfaces appropriately.

üìå Prevents runtime failures in polymorphic code

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

> Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use

### ‚ùå Problem

```java
public interface MegaOrderService {
    void validate();
    void notify();
    void refund();
    void log();
}
```

### ‚úÖ Split Interfaces

```java
public interface Validator { void validate(); }
public interface Notifier { void notify(); }
public interface Refundable { void refund(); }
```

üìå Promotes **modular microservices**, better unit testing

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on **abstractions**

### ‚ùå Tight Coupling

```java
public class OrderService {
    private RazorpayGateway gateway = new RazorpayGateway();
}
```

### ‚úÖ Use Interfaces

```java
public class OrderService {
    private PaymentGateway gateway;
    public OrderService(PaymentGateway gateway) {
        this.gateway = gateway;
    }
}
```

üìå Enables **testability**, **mocking**, **plug-n-play** architecture

---

# üî• Bonus Principles (Critical in Supply Chain, Microservices)

---

## üß± Composition Over Inheritance

> Prefer **has-a** over **is-a**

‚úÖ Use components or strategy objects instead of class hierarchies.

üîß Applied in:

* Chain of Responsibility ‚Üí plug validators
* Strategy pattern ‚Üí inject behavior like payment or discount

---

## üîÑ DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself)

> Every piece of logic should exist in one place.

‚úÖ Use shared `Validator`, `Mapper`, or `Logger` utility classes.
‚úÖ Reuse logic across `Order`, `Invoice`, and `Shipment`.

---

## ‚úÇÔ∏è YAGNI (You Aren‚Äôt Gonna Need It)

> Don't write code until it's really needed.

‚ùå Avoid building ‚Äúretry logic,‚Äù ‚Äúcaching,‚Äù or ‚Äúmulti-warehouse rules‚Äù **before** there is a requirement.

‚úÖ Keeps systems clean and simple under load.

---

## ü§è KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

> Simple = maintainable & scalable

‚ùå Don't design async Kafka pipelines when HTTP + DB does the job.
‚úÖ Avoid unnecessary abstractions and patterns unless justified.

---

| NotificationService       | Observer + ISP    | Sends email, SMS independently               |
| OrderProcessor (Template) | DIP + LSP         | Works with all Order types (B2C, B2B)        |

| ------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Large class doing multiple things     | SRP                |
| You need to add new features often    | OCP                |
| You‚Äôre extending classes/interfaces   | LSP / ISP          |
| You want flexibility in your logic    | Strategy / DIP     |
| You‚Äôre building rule engines or flows | CoR + Composition  |
| You‚Äôre designing reusable libraries   | DRY / DIP          |
| You feel your design is bloated       | KISS / YAGNI       |

## üß™ Interview Questions They May Ask

| Question                                    | Ideal Answer                                 |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| How do you keep OrderService manageable?    | SRP + ISP + DIP                              |
| What if a new discount logic is added?      | Apply OCP with Strategy pattern              |
| How do you avoid tight coupling?            | DIP with interfaces/factories                |
| Why is Composition better than Inheritance? | More flexibility, avoids brittle hierarchies |
| How do you keep your services testable?     | Use abstractions + Dependency Injection      |
