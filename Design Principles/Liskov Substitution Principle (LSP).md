Excellent, Eshwar! Let's deep-dive into the **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** ‚Äî the **3rd SOLID principle**, vital for writing **polymorphic, extensible**, and **safe enterprise-grade software**, especially in complex domains like **supply chain platforms** where components evolve and interoperate.

# ‚úÖ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) ‚Äì Full Guide with Cheat Sheet + LLD Examples

---

## üí° What is LSP?

> **"Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types."**
> ‚Äî *Barbara Liskov*

### In plain English:

You should be able to **replace a superclass object** with any of its **subclasses** **without breaking the system**.

If your code uses a superclass or interface, it **shouldn‚Äôt care** which implementation it gets ‚Äî it must **just work**.

---

## üîß Key Rule

If a subclass **changes the behavior** of a superclass in a way that **violates expected results**, then **LSP is broken**.

---

## ‚ùó Why is it Critical in High-Traffic Systems?

* Helps avoid **runtime bugs** when using polymorphism.
* Makes systems **safe to extend** ‚Äî especially when plugging in new modules (e.g., shipping carriers, pricing rules).
* Ensures consistency when **injecting implementations** via interfaces in services or pipelines.

---

## üö´ Anti-Pattern (LSP Violation)

```java
class ShippingProvider {
    public double calculateShippingCost(Order order) {
        return 100;
    }
}

class InMemoryMockShippingProvider extends ShippingProvider {
    public double calculateShippingCost(Order order) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Not supported in mock");
    }
}
```

### ‚ùå What's the Problem?

* `InMemoryMockShippingProvider` extends `ShippingProvider`
* But it **violates the contract** by throwing an exception
* This will **break clients** expecting valid shipping cost ‚Üí violates LSP

---

## ‚úÖ LSP Refactored Solution

### ‚úÖ Use Interface-Based Composition

```java
public interface ShippingProvider {
    double calculateShippingCost(Order order);
}

public class FedExShippingProvider implements ShippingProvider {
    public double calculateShippingCost(Order order) {
        return 150;
    }
}

public class MockShippingProvider implements ShippingProvider {
    public double calculateShippingCost(Order order) {
        return 0; // returns a dummy cost, doesn‚Äôt throw exception
    }
}
```

Now you can safely substitute any provider, including mocks.
‚úÖ LSP is preserved.
‚úÖ Clients get consistent behavior.

## üè≠ Real-World Supply Chain Use Cases

| Base Type           | Subtype                              | Expected Substitution                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `PaymentGateway`    | `Razorpay`, `Stripe`, `MockGateway`  | Should all support `pay()` and `refund()`  |
| `ShippingProvider`  | `FedEx`, `BlueDart`, `LocalCourier`  | Should behave the same to the caller       |
| `DiscountStrategy`  | `LoyaltyDiscount`, `PartnerDiscount` | Must not break if strategy is switched     |
| `TaxRule`           | `GSTIndia`, `VATUK`                  | Each should follow same interface contract |
| `InventoryProvider` | `WarehouseService`, `InMemoryMock`   | Same behavior on `checkAvailability()`     |

---

## üß© LLD Problem: LSP in Shipping Label Generator

### ‚ùìProblem:

You have a base `ShippingLabelGenerator`. Clients use it to print shipping labels.
You now add a `PDFShippingLabelGenerator` and a `DBShippingLabelGenerator`.

But one of them throws exception for unsupported operations.

---

### ‚ùå LSP Violation Code

```java
public class DBShippingLabelGenerator extends ShippingLabelGenerator {
    public void printLabel(Order order) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Printing not supported");
    }
}
```

üìõ This violates LSP:

* Client expecting to call `printLabel()` will fail.

---

### ‚úÖ LSP-Compliant Version

```java
public interface ShippingLabelGenerator {
    void generateLabel(Order order);
}

public class PDFShippingLabelGenerator implements ShippingLabelGenerator {
    public void generateLabel(Order order) {
        // generate PDF
    }
}

public class DBShippingLabelGenerator implements ShippingLabelGenerator {
    public void generateLabel(Order order) {
        // generate DB entry
    }
}
```

‚úÖ Both implementations support the full interface
‚úÖ Clients won‚Äôt crash regardless of which implementation is injected

## üìå How to Recognize LSP Violations in Code

| Code Smell                                         | Violation               |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Subclass throws `UnsupportedOperationException`    | Breaks substitutability |
| Subclass changes core behavior (e.g., skips logic) | Breaks expected results |
| You check `instanceof` to differentiate subtypes   | LSP likely broken       |
| Subclass returns invalid/null/unexpected result    | Violates contract       |

## ‚úÖ Final Thought

If you‚Äôre building a **modular, pluggable, and extensible system** (like a supply chain platform), respecting LSP ensures that:

* **All plugins work safely**
* **Mocks behave like real services**
* **Future teams don‚Äôt break functionality unknowingly**

---

Would you like to move to **Interface Segregation Principle** next or try a **live LLD mock** applying SRP + OCP + LSP in one flow (e.g., ‚ÄúDesign a Payment Gateway System‚Äù)?
